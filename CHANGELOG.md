### Design Principles
1. **Local-First Architecture**
   - Chat history stored in browser's local storage
   - API keys stored in secure cookies
   - Minimized server dependency for core features

2. **Real-Time Interaction**
   - Streaming responses for immediate feedback
   - Asynchronous agent processing
   - Non-blocking UI updates

3. **Security-First Approach**
   - Client-side API key management
   - No sensitive data storage on server
   - XSS prevention in markdown rendering

### Risks and Notes
1. **Known Limitations**
   - Large chat histories may impact local storage limits
   - Browser storage clearing will reset chat history
   - API key needs to be re-entered after cache clear

2. **Security Considerations**
   - API keys stored in browser cookies
   - Consider implementing key encryption
   - Review XSS vulnerabilities in markdown

3. **Performance Notes**
   - Multiple agents may increase response time
   - Large chat histories may affect UI performance
   - Consider implementing pagination
